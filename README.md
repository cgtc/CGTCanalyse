This package was created to hold some functions that just collect a load of tidymodel functions into one. For example, a random forest classification function where you can specify all the parameters of the model in a single function instead of creating a load of intermediate variables. It can also get some downstream metrics a little quicker than typing out all the intermediate steps you would normally have to write in tidymodels (e.g. get local importances from a model, or a confusion matrix).
